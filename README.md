# Smart Text Extractor (Since 2019)

The primary function of the Smart Text Extractor is to extract text from an image taken by a smartphone's camera or retrieved from its gallery.

## Preparation

1) Generate the skeleton of this project using **Crowdbotics**.
2) Confirm the list of dependencies in **package.json** and install them using the command: `npm install`
4) Create the **Firebase** and **Google Vision** accounts needed for this project. Install Firebase modules: `npm install --save firebase`
5) **Find API keys on Firebase and Google Visions dashboards** and place them in an **environment.js or .env file** (Remember to mention these files in .gitignore!)
6) Keys are invoked by the main JavaScript file **App.js** via a **firebase.js** file, which must be in the same folder as the environment.js file 
7) Note that after loading the app via the **Expo CLI**, you will be asked to grant the app permission to access your smartphone's gallery and camera

## App.js

An explanation of the functions in App.js:
1) **uploadImageAsync** - Store images captured by the smartphone's camera in Firebase

2)  **_takePhoto** - responsible for the app's ability to take photos
3)  **_pickImage** - responsible for the app's ability to retrieve gallery images
4)  **submitToGoogle** - submits image to the Text Detection API from Google Vision

## Use Case 1

This is an image retrieved from my gallery:

The image is now picked and uploaded to the app for text extraction:

The output will be as below:

## Use case 2
This is an image of a document taken by my smartphoneâ€™s camera. It can be cropped to produce:

The user can now upload the cropped image to the app for extraction:

## Use case 3
If an image does not contain any text, there will be no output available:

In the course of building this app, I referred to the project below, which focused on labelling logos in images.
